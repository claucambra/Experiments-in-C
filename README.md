# Experiments-in-C
Trying small things out as I learn C.

## dice.c
A small terminal dice program that lets you select a custom number of dice and their sides, and then roll them.

dice.c also keeps track of the totals of each of the dice rolls, letting you view the stats for most common rolls.

When rolling six-sided dice, you get a nice ASCII drawing of the results. Since they were drawn by me, they're a bit wonky, but they get the point across!

### pyramid_builder.c
As old as time itself, this is yet another example of the pyramid **(read: isolateral triangle)** printing app that all programming classes force their students to make. Though instead, I forced myself to do it.

Run the program with the -h parameter and an integer value and see a pyramid with a height of your choosing spat out into your terminal window.

### times-table.c
This one almost explains itself: the program asks you for a number, and then asks you up to which other number you'd like it to be multiplied. The output is a multiplication table of each multiplication and it's result between number 1 up to and including number 2.

### zodiac-sign.c
Provide the program with your birth month and birth date, and receive your zodiac sign, if you somehow didn't know yours by now!
